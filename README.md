#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It plays a vital role in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software systems and applications that power aspects of modern life. For example, through development of web applications such as google, we can easily get information and knowledge at the comfort of our homes and easily communicate with others


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's. This has helped in the rowth of the technological world through development of various software applications and systems.
2. Advent of structured programming in the 1970's. This helped in promoting a more organized and logical approach to coding hence an improved and clear code.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000's.This has helped in delivery of high quality softwares through a focus on flexibility, collaboration and respopnding to changes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- This where gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements is done.
2. Design- This is through creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- In this phase, codes are written and the software is built.
4. Testing- The quality assurance engineer conducts various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment- The software is released to the customers or users in this phase.
6. Maintenance- After the software is deployed, this phase provides ongoing support, updates and enhancement of the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. In terms of approach, waterfall is sequential and linear hence flowing downwards whereas agile is iterative and incremental.
2. Waterfall is rigid since it follows a sequence whereas agile is flexible and open to changes.
3. In terms of testing, waterfall brings along high risks due to late testing whereas in agile there is continous testing hence reduced risks.
   Waterfall would be appropriate for government projects since they require extensive documentation and following of strict guidelines whereas agile methodologies would be appropriate for game development which requires frequent testing and feedback to improve user experience.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer- Writes codes and implements software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.This is by ensuring it is completed with the scope, budget and time.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs- This tool provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes. This helps enhance productivity and code quality. An example includes; Visual Studio code
2. VCS- Helps in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members  hence enhancing collaborations an d productivity.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changes in the requirements can lead to project delay and scope creep.
2. Tight deadlines. This is where time given to complete a particular project is limited which might alter with the quality of the system softwares or applications.
3. Technical debt. This hinders the software maintainability, scalability and performance over time.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing- This is testing of individual components or modules of the software. This helps in early bug detection and enhances code development speed.
2. Integration testing-It involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.It helps ensure proper data flow and interaction between integrated parts since there is detection of interface issues hence reduced post deployment failures.
3. System testing- It involves testing the entire software as a whole to ensure it meets all functional and non functional requirements. It helps ensure that the entire system performs as intended and it meets it's stakeholders needs
4. Acceptance testing- This involves testing the software against the user. It ensures the software meets the intended purpose and functions correctly in a real world environment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It helps in making your questions clear and specific for AI to understand exactly what you need. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Write about technology
Correct- Write a 300-words article on the importance of artificial intelligence on the hotel industry highlighting both the advantages and challenges faced
The prompt is more effective because;
1. Clear-It specifies that the focus is on artificial intelligence in the hotel industry.
2. Concise- There are specific requirements highlighting that the article should contain 300 words.
3. Complete-Asks for both the advantages and challenges faced.
4. Correct- It is a balanced discussion.
